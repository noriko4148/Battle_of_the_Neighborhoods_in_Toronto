## Battle of the Neighborhoods in Toronto Canada
This is for IBM Data Science Capstone, "The battle of Neighborhoods in Toronto Canada". Over 10 months, I have completed 8 courses from Data Management to Machine Learning. This project is a great oppotunity to utilize and confirm the all knowledge and the information obtained throughout the courses for Data Science Professional Certification. For this project, we will use the both data from Toronoto Canada and New York US to find out which city is more suitable to open Revolving Sushi Chain restaurants out of this data analysis. Both Toronto and New York are the most populous, diverse, financial and media capital cities in the both countries.
